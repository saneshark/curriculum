# Curriculum

Curriculum for teaching some Ruby on Rails Full-stack Development

## Setting up development stack

Use the command line, Sublime Text, GitHub, and Exercism https://exercism.io/

1. Github Account: Create an account for free at https://github.com/ and complete the guide at guides.github.com

2. Command Line: Install iterm from https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html

3. Using Iterm, run `irb` and you can begin writing ruby code examples right inside the terminal. You can use Control + C to exit irb when needed or just type exit. This is useful for doing exercises from various guides.

4. Sublime Text: Install sublime text editor from https://www.sublimetext.com/. This text editor is really nice for "syntax highlighting" or being able to see code you've written in a way that is easy on the eyes.

5. Other sources: Read Why's Poignant guide to ruby. https://poignant.guide/

6. Coding Challenges: get setup with an exercism.io account so you can start doing some minor code exercises.
